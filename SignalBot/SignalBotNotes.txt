Motivation:
There are a plethora of crytpo communities on discord that give out daily trading signals for their members. The goal of this bot is to use those trading signals to automate trades

Architecture:
- uses a microservices architecture 
- server.py is the host, discordscraper.py and main.py are the clients
- discordscraper connects the discord bot (via a token) to the crypto channel. Here it listens to messages and sends POST requests to the server.
- server saves messages in a list
- main makes GET requests, then uses the process message function to filter noise and trading signal
- main uses the signals to automate trading
