Motivation:
There are a plethora of crytpo communities on discord that give out daily trading signals for their members. The goal of this bot is to use those trading signals to automate trades

Architecture:
- This project uses a microservices architecture where server.py is the host, DiscordScraper.py and main.py are the clients
- Server.py uses fastapi to run a local server. This server acts like a data base. It receives messages from discord and sends messages to our trading bot.
- DiscordScraper.py allows our discord bot to continuously listen for messages and send POST requests to our server.
- Main.py will send get GET requests to retrieve signals and use them to enter trades on Coinbase 
    
Functionality:
- discordscraper sends a list of strings to the server. 
- The server takes each element and adds it to a new list that lives in the server. 
- Every time main makes a GET request, the server sends over its current list and then empties it so it does not send duplicates.
- Then the process message function will take that list and decide which element, or message, is a trading signal and discard the rest
- Finally we append each processed message to our list of signals. 
- The idea here is that the bot will accumulate signals over time and refer to this list when it needs to enter a position.

TODO:

- Need to define what a trading signal is:
    - what parameters define a signal? a signal should have a ticker, position type ie long or short, ...
    - after defining that we can finish the process message function ie create an algorithm to classify whether messages are trading signals or not 

- main needs to have a state machine:
    - Buy state: looks at our signals and have some kind of logic to enter a position. 
    - Sell state: looks at our position have some logic on when to exit
    - Idle state (?)

-  Need to figure out how to place orders
    - Coinbasetest.py shows us how to sign in however we will need to learn the functionality behind entering and exiting positions
