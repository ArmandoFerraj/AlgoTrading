Motivation:
There are a plethora of crytpo communities on discord that give out daily trading signals for their members. The goal of this bot is to use those trading signals to automate trades

Goals:
1.) automate trades with discord signals and start making profits
2.) scale the project up to have a database - the idea here is to share the database with people. more signals = more profit

Architecture:
---goal 1---:
- uses a microservices architecture 
- server.py is the host, discordscraper.py and main.py are the clients
- discordscraper connects the discord bot (via a token) to the crypto channel. Here it listens to messages and sends POST requests to the server.
- server saves messages in a list
- main makes GET requests, then uses the process message function to filter noise and trading signal
- main uses the signals to automate trading

        ---goal 2---:
        - uses microservices architecture and a database
        - discord scraper sends messages to fast api, fast api processes the messages then sends trading signals to the database
        - The database is its own server that is hosted on the internet
        - main program connects to the databases, retrieves trading signals and starts trading!
        - Therefore anyone who wants to trade does not need the discord bot or the fast api files
        - all they need is connection to the database and they can start making money!
        - however anyone can utilize discordscraper, use their own token, and contribute to the database




TODO:
- Need to define what a trading signal is:
    - what parameters define a signal? 
    - a signal should have a ticker, position type (long or short), anything else?
    - decide what data structure we want trading signals to be, e.g. a dictionary? {ticker:"btc", pos:"long", ...}
    
- finish the process message function
    - create an algorithm to classify whether incoming messages are trading signals or noise

- Need to figure out how to place orders
    - for long/shorts write functions to enter and exit positions on coing base
    - verify they work as intended

- Need to work on the state machine logic and functionality
    - Define an entrance/exit strategy
            - trading signals tell us what to do BUT how much do we risk per trade? 
            - e.g. we can define each trade as 1 unit, where 1 unit can be x% of our portfolio 
            - when do we take the lost and exit?
            - when do we take profit and exit?
            - verify you can place orders inside of the state machine
    - need robust saftey protocols 
        - disconnections to the server might break our code
        - perahps design a kill switch that exits all positions and stops trading
        - etc...
